# About the Derivations
These derivations show how many of the equations used in Pynite were derived. They are Jupyter Notebooks. To view them properly, you'll need to have either Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed. This is a free library for scientific computing available here: https://jupyter.org/. You'll also need to have Sympy installed. Sympy is a symbolic math library for Python that was used to symbolically evaluate many of these equations. All outputs have been cleared in these derivations to minimize the amount of space the math formatting takes up in the Pynite repository. Once you open a derivation in Jupyter you'll need to run all cells to view the output.
