        ----------
        Direction : string
            The direction to plot the deflection for. Must be one of the following:
                'dx' = Deflection in the local x-direction (axial deflection)
                'dy' = Deflection in the local y-direction (usually the strong-axis).
                'dz' = Deflection in the local z-direction (usually the weak-axis).
        n_points: int
            The number of points in the array to generate over the full length of the member.
        combo_name : string
            The name of the load combination to get the results for (not the load combination itself).
        x_array : array = None
            A custom array of x values that may be provided by the user, otherwise an array is generated. Values must be provided in local member coordinates (between 0 and L) and be in ascending order
